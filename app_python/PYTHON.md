# Python Web Application Best Practices

## Project Structure:

The project follows a clear and organized structure:

- **app.py:** The main entry point for the Flask application.
- **templates:** A folder for storing HTML templates.

## Coding Standards (PEP 8):

Adherence to PEP 8 coding standards ensures readability:

- **Consistent Naming:** Clear and consistent variable names.
- **Indentation:** Consistent indentation for improved code readability.
- **Modularization:** Encapsulation of functionality promotes modularity.

## Testing:

Basic unit testing has been implemented:

- **Route Testing:** Ensures the main route (`'/'`) returns the expected content.

## Code Quality:

Several practices are in place to maintain high-quality code:

- **Flask Best Practices:** Adherence to Flask best practices, including route decorators.
- **Error Handling:** Implementation of proper error handling.
- **Code Comments:** Provided comments for complex logic or functionalities.

By following these best practices, the Flask web application maintains a clean, readable, and maintainable codebase.
