# Continuous Integration Best Practices

## CI Status Indicator

We've incorporated a CI status indicator into our repository to provide transparency. This indicator reflects the current state of our CI pipeline and is located at the top of our README.md file.

## Recommended Practices

We've adopted several strategies to refine our CI process:

- We've set time limits on our workflows to avoid endless execution.
- We've restricted the workflow token's scope to minimize the impact in case of a security breach.
- We've locked our actions to specific commit hashes to ensure the use of a stable version of each action.
- We're considering implementing a concurrency control mechanism to prevent simultaneous workflow executions.
- We're evaluating the necessity of each trigger to minimize unnecessary workflow invocations.
- We're using encrypted secrets for sensitive information (e.g., Docker Hub credentials, Snyc token).

## Efficient Build Processing

We've leveraged build caching to boost the efficiency of our workflows. Our Python dependencies are cached, and this cache is reused in subsequent runs as long as the `requirements.txt` file remains unchanged.
